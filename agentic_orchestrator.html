This is a rapidly evolving field, and we can expect to see significant advancements and new applications of agentic frameworks in the coming years.


**What are Agentic Frameworks?**

Agentic frameworks are AI systems designed to act more autonomously and purposefully. They go beyond simple reactive responses and can:

*   Interpret complex instructions
*   Set subgoals to achieve tasks
*   Make adaptive choices in real-time
*   Learn and improve over time
